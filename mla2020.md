# CFP: “The State of the Syllabus” Roundtable

The syllabus plays multiple roles in academe: it serves as a guide to a course for students; an intellectual provocation; a description of a field; a representation of scholarship; a contract. With the advent of projects such as the Open Syllabus Project and repositories such as Humanities CORE, along with the popular use of social media, the syllabus has emerged as an open and connected space for conversation and argument. It renders pedagogical labor visible as it is shared, along with other materials, in repositories and social media streams. Such openness carries with it both possibilities and risks.

For this session at MLA 2020, we seek short provocations on roles that the syllabus plays -- for instance, the syllabus as open document; the syllabus as contract; the syllabus as blank slate. Proposals should posit a “syllabus as” concept and articulate it in 200-300 words. At the session itself, participants will offer 5 minute position papers on their concept and then invite the audience to a moderated conversation about the current state of the syllabus.
